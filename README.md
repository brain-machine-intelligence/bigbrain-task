(A) Sequential two-choice Markov decision task. A participant starts from the initial state (S1) and makes two sequential choices (A1, A2) to get a reward in the goal state (S3). The state-action-state transitions are made with the probability p. Each fractal image indicates a distinct state ID. (B) There are two types of contexts: goal (specific or flexible goal condition) and uncertainty (high or low uncertainty level associated with different state-action-state probability (p) values). In the specific goal condition, subjects receive a reward only if the collected coin color matches the color of the coin box, whereas all colors of coins are redeemable in the flexible goal condition.
